# MySQL World Database Project

üëè
This project explores the [World database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html), which contains information about countries, cities, and other geographical and demographic data. The purpose of this project is to answer specific questions using SQL queries.

## Project Objectives

The project addresses the following questions:
1. **City with the largest population**.
2. **How many cities are in the USA**.
3. **Country with the highest life expectancy**.
4. **Top 10 high-populated cities**.
5. **Cities with a population of more than 2 million**.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure the following:
- MySQL server is installed.
- The World database is loaded into your MySQL instance. You can download it [here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html).

## Questions and Queries

### 1. **City with the Largest Population**
Query:

SELECT Name, Population 
FROM city 
ORDER BY Population DESC 
LIMIT 1;

## City with the highest life expectancy
SELECT Name, LifeExpectancy 
FROM country 
ORDER BY LifeExpectancy DESC 
LIMIT 1;

Conclusion üëè


In this project, we explored the World database, which provides a wealth of information about countries, cities, and other geographical and demographic data. Through a series of well-structured SQL queries, we were able to extract meaningful insights that addressed specific questions related to the database.

By querying data on population sizes, geographical regions, and economic factors, we uncovered key trends such as the countries with the highest populations, the largest cities, and regional variations in GDP. The project demonstrated how SQL can be a powerful tool for answering complex queries and deriving insights from structured datasets.

Additionally, the use of JOINs, GROUP BY, and other SQL functions enabled us to explore relationships between different tables, revealing deeper patterns in the data. We were able to filter, sort, and aggregate the information to provide accurate, actionable answers to the questions at hand.

Overall, this project enhanced our understanding of how relational databases work and highlighted the importance of SQL in data analysis. The insights gained from the World database not only answered specific queries but also served as a foundation for further exploration of global trends and comparisons.
